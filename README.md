node.js
1. make sure you npm install the packages
2. then run node server.js in the terminal 
3. go live on html 

another note in my movie.js I had originally imported my API with just node fetch and express & all of it is commented out, It was working and I want to keep it on my file for future reference to work on this project in different ways.
